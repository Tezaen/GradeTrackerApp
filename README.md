### Iteration 1

**User Story:** Created DB and DAO by Roober
> I started out creating the DB and DAO in this iteration by having courses, assignments, and users.
> I was debating on whether or not to include Enrollment, Category, and Grades Object in. At the end of this iteration, I did.

**User Story:** Began Login by Yvonne
> I first has to set up my whole environment on my computer and refamiliarize myself with Android Studio
> I began the Login screen


### Iteration 2

**User Story** Create Account Activity and First Activity by Roober
> This iteration, I created the first version of create account activity as well as started on the main screen of
> grade tracker app. 

**User Story:** Login and Test by Yvonne
> I finished up the Login page, set up tests for it, and had it connected to the DB
> The Login test specifically was not working

### Iteration 3

**User Story** Created Unit Tests by Roober
> This iteration, I created unit tests that tested the functionalities of the UserLog, CourseLog, and AssignmentLog objects in the Database.
> Grade, Category, and Enrollment didn't seem to fit in with what we had so we let it go, I also worked on the Grades Activity
> It calculated the average of all scores in the course that it displays.

**User Story:** Design by Yvonne
> I implemented a new button and color scheme design on all the displayed activities

###Iteration 4

**Courses/Assignment
> This iteration, I created the add/edit/delete for the assignments and courses which allows the user to interact with the app. Everytime the user logs in they have their own unique course and assignments shown to them when they interact with the app. Everytime the user edits a course the assignments under that course get changed to the new course that was edited. As well when a user deletes a course every assignment under that course is removed from the database. The user can eddit their assignment name, grade, but cannot edit the course name when editing the assignment.
