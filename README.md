### Iteration 1

**User Story:** Created DB and DAO by Roober

### Iteration 3

**User Story** Created Unit Tests by Roober
> This iteration, I created unit tests that tested the functionalities of the UserLog, CourseLog, and AssignmentLog objects in the Database.
> Grade, Category, and Enrollment didn't seem to fit in with what we had so we let it go, I also worked on the Grades Activity
> It calculated the average of all scores in the course that it displays.
